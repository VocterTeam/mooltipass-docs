## The Mooltipass Project

With time, logins and passwords have become critical elements we need to remember to access the different websites and services we use daily. If we want to achieve good security, each of these credential sets should be unique.
We therefore created the Mooltipass, a physical password keeper that remembers and encrypts your credentials so you don't have to. With this device, you can generate and safely store long and complex passwords. A personal PIN locked smartcard allows the decryption of your credentials and ensures that only you have access to them. Simply visit a website and the device will ask for your confirmation to enter your credentials when login is required.
The Mooltipass is a standalone device connected through USB, is completely driver-less and is compatible with all major operating systems on PCs, Macs and Smartphones. [More info](https://www.themooltipass.com/)

By clicking on the key icon inside a password field, you can bring up the Mooltipass password generator.
In the rare cases where the 
extension doesn’t pick up a credential submit event, you may also use this menu to manually trigger a credential storage procedure. 

### Selecting Custom Credential Fields

The Mooltipass extension searches for credential fields in the web pages you visit. 
When it finds them, it displays a key icon in the password field, as shown above. 

In the rare case the credential fields aren’t
picked up, you may tell the app about them by clicking this item in the extension menu.
