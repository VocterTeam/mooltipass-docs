1. It would be great if extension menu has nice icons for each menu item. 
For example when user opens the extension menu it's hard to detect which menu item need (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VocterTeam/mooltipass-docs/dev/images/user-manual-extension-menu.jpg)
2. There's a lot of small icons/images using in extension (https://github.com/limpkin/mooltipass/tree/master/chrome_extension/images, https://github.com/limpkin/mooltipass/tree/master/chrome_extension/icons) I think it's a good idea to use svg sprites for it. Just one file for all icons. Alternatively we could use png sprite but SVG will be preferable
3. Also we could reduce the size of the extenstion by minimizing files: js, css
4. I think we could add some functionality to ask user if he really wants to remove the credential (https://image.prntscr.com/image/lB7Pgw91QqKKiyfEFa346Q.png) Because i've remove one accidentally.
5. Looks like the footer is collapsed (https://image.prntscr.com/image/5UmcDL-7R3SAQ8L1HipYog.png) This issue is related to float behavior. We could add "clearfix" to this element.
6. What build-system are you using on this project? Maybe you could try some of those: Gulp, Webpack, etc. These tools are very helpfull in case you have many modules, dependencies, etc.
